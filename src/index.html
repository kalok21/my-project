  This HTML file serves as the entry point for the application.
  It includes the root div where the React app will be mounted,
  and links to the main TypeScript file that bootstraps the app.
  The language is set to Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) and the viewport
  is configured for responsive design.
  The favicon is set to a SVG file located in the root directory.
  The title of the page is "個人管理系統" (Personal Management System).
-->
<!--
  Note: Ensure that the paths to the favicon and main script are correct
  relative to the server root. The script type is set to "module" to
  enable ES module syntax in the main TypeScript file.
  The charset is set to UTF-8 to support a wide range of characters,
  including Traditional Chinese characters.
  The viewport meta tag ensures the application is responsive on mobile devices.

<!--  This file is processed by Vite, which handles the module loading and
  development server setup.
  Make sure to run the Vite development server to see the changes live.
  You can start the server with the command: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
  For production builds, Vite will optimize and bundle the application.
  The final output will be served from the `dist` directory.
  Ensure that your project structure aligns with the paths specified here.
  The main TypeScript file (`main.tsx`) should contain the React application
  initialization logic, including rendering the root component into the
  `#root` div.

<!--  This HTML file is essential for the initial loading of the React application.
  It should not contain any inline scripts or styles that could interfere
  with the React rendering process. All styles and scripts  should be
  managed through the Vite build process to ensure optimal performance
  and maintainability.
  Keep this file clean and focused on the structure of the HTML document.
  Any additional metadata or links to stylesheets can be added in the head section.
  For example, you can link to external stylesheets or include meta tags
  for SEO purposes.
  Remember to validate the HTML to ensure it adheres to standards and is
  accessible to all users.
  Use semantic HTML where possible to improve the document structure
  and enhance accessibility.
  Consider adding ARIA roles or attributes if your application requires
  additional accessibility features.
  Regularly review and update this file as your application evolves.
  This will help maintain clarity and ensure that the entry point remains
  aligned with the overall architecture of your React application.
  For more information on Vite and its configuration options,
  refer to the official Vite documentation at https://vitejs.dev/.
  This will help you leverage Vite's features effectively and keep your
  development workflow efficient.
  If you encounter any issues with the setup or need to customize the
  build process, consult the Vite documentation or community forums
  for guidance. The Vite community is active and can provide support
  for common challenges and advanced configurations.
  Always test your application in different browsers and devices to ensure
  compatibility and a consistent user experience. This includes checking
  the rendering of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript across various platforms.
  Use tools like Lighthouse to audit your application for performance,
  accessibility, and best practices. This will help you identify areas
  for improvement and ensure that your application meets modern web standards.
  Keep your dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest features
  and security patches. Regularly check for updates to Vite, React,
  and any other libraries you are using in your project.
  This will help maintain the stability and security of your application.
  Finally, consider setting up a version control system like Git to track
  changes to your project files. This will allow you to revert changes,
  collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project's development.
  Use meaningful commit messages to document the changes you make,
  and consider using branches for new features or bug fixes to keep your
  main branch stable.
  By following these guidelines, you can create a robust and maintainable
  entry point for your React application that serves as a solid foundation
  for your personal management system.
